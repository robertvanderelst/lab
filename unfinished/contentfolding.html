            <h1>The Last Temptation of Homer</h1>
            <p>You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. I stand by my racial slur. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Save me, Jeebus. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.</p>
            <h2>Cape Feare</h2>
            <p>Human contact: the final frontier. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Me fail English? That's unpossible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</li>
                <li>D'oh.</li>
                <li>I've done everything the Bible says &mdash; even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!</li>
                <li>Me fail English? That's unpossible.</li>

            <h3>Rosebud</h3>
            <p>I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.</p>
            <h4>Homer: Bad Man</h4>
            <p>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love! I've done everything the Bible says &mdash; even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity&hellip;</li>
                <li>Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Homer Alone</h5>
            <p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>
