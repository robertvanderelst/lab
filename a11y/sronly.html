    <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like <a href="#"><span class="sr-only">You shouldn't be able to see this</span>these sweet mornings</a> of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
